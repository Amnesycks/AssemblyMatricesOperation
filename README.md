## Coursework System Programming

# Description of the project
  The purpose of this project is to perform some binary operation on integer matrices (addition, subtraction and multiplication).
  The assembly functions need dynamic allocated array (int**) and return another dynamic allocated array well sized.
  In case of error the functions return a NULL pointer, that should be handled in the caller code. Also the memory should be free after use.

# Compilation of the project
The project use a Makefile to perform Compilation

```make```: Compile the project

```make clean```: Remove the object files and the binary

# Execution of the project
```./asmfunctions```: Execute the test program, no arguments needed
